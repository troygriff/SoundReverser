# SoundReverser
SoundReverser reads a sound file in .dat format and writes another .dat sound file which is the reverse of the first. The class Reverse has a main method that reads in a .dat, pushes all the sound values on a stack, then pops them all off and writes them into a new .dat sound file. DStack defines a stack that holds double values.

This is an example of an implementation of a stack using an array and a linked list.
